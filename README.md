**Cute Demon Crashers!** is a silly little short game that gives a lazy virgin
college student a fun and safe space to explore her first sexual experience
with a partner of her choice, if she so desires. It focuses on consent and sex
positivity (and also fluff). You can check the [SugarScript][] for more
information about the game, including download links.

This repository contains the source code for the game, written in a mix of
Ren'Py and Python. It's been cleaned up from the NaNoRenO crunching and
comments/examples have been added throughout the code to make it easier to
understand.

If you have any questions about the source code, feel free to email me on
queen@robotlolita.me, or through Twitter
[@robotlolita](https://twitter.com/robotlolita), and I'll try my best to answer
them! â™¥


## Running the game

Only the source code is provided in this repository, so if you want to play
around with it and run the game with your changes, you'll need to:

 1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/robotlolita/cute-demon-crashers/archive/master.zip)
    (or you can clone it, if you're familiar with git).

 2. [Download the actual game](http://sugarscript.itch.io/cute-demon-crashers)

 3. Extract the assets from the game and put them in the game folder.

 4. Run it through Ren'Py.


## Documentation

The source code is heavily documented (and commented) in a sort of
literate-style programming, so you should be able to follow the source as if
reading an article or book.

An alternative version can be [read online][], which emphasises the
descriptions and textual presentation/structure.

You can also build the documentation locally by running `make
documentation`. This assumes you've got [Make][], [Node.js][] and [Sphinx][]
installed.
